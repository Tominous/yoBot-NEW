A new and improved module based version of yoBot, containing more than just fun commands, such as punishments, etc.

# About this bot:
yoBot v2.0 is coded entirely in JavaScript, using node.js and discord.js. I originally planned to code this in Java w/ JDA, but I couldn't register my event listeners in JDA, and I searched up essentially everything on how to fix it, nothing did, so I just decided to use JavaScript.

The goal of this bot is to make it so that if you use this bot in your server, you wont need ANY other bot. This is why it will contain fun commands as well as punishments & staff utilities, a music feature, toggleable level system, and more.

  - ^bonk \<member\>
  - ^say \<message\>
